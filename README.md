# Used_Car_Price_Analysis
The Used Car Price Analysis project focuses on understanding and predicting the market value of pre-owned vehicles using data analytics and machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and location, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that influence car prices. The results help buyers, sellers, and dealerships make data-driven decisions and ensure fair pricing in the used car market.
